### What I learned

This Frontend Mentor challenge was a great hands-on learning experience. I improved my CSS layout skills, especially using flexbox and positioning for responsive design. Experimenting with  helped me refine pseudo-element styling, including absolute positioning and transformations. I also learned how pointer-events affect user interactions, ensuring hidden elements donâ€™t interfere. Additionally, working with responsive techniques made me more aware of scalable units and media queries. Most importantly, I realized that building projects is the best way to solidify concepts, making learning more practical and rewarding. ðŸš€
